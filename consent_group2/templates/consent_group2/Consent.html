    <li><b>Procedures to be followed:</b> You will be asked to take part in an online game where you will play the role of a decision maker. During this process, you may also take part in a coffee tasting. The computer will calculate your profit from each round based on a predetermined equation. After you complete the game, you will complete a survey that asks questions about your consumption habits, attitudes, and demographic information. The research study will take no more than 60 minutes to complete.</li>
    <li><b>Discomforts and Risks:</b> There are no risks in participating in this research beyond those experienced in everyday life.</li>
    <li><b>Benefits:</b> This research might provide a better understanding of how people make decisions. You may find participation interesting and enjoyable.</li>

    <li><b>Statement of Confidentiality & Access to Data:</b> Your participation in this research is confidential. All data will be stored in a password protected electronic database. The task does not ask for any information that would identify to whom the responses belong. In the event of any publication or presentation resulting from the research, no personally identifiable information will be shared because your name is in no way linked to your responses.
