Your offer is accepted, and now you would play the role of a marketing manager. The market manager receives the procurement manager’s offer to purchase and would decide the retail price (R) for the products.If the retail price is higher than the average consumers’ willingness to pay (P), the retail trade will be failed. If the retail price is lower or equal to the average consumers’ willingness to pay, the retail trade will occur.<br>
The experiment will automatically calculate your potential payoffs as the marketing manager.<br>
The payoffs are denoted in points. The points you earned in this step will be transferred into actual dollars.<br>
