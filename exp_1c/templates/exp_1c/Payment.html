            If the <u>Supplier</u> <b>accepts</b>your offer, your coffee will be offered for sale at the chain’s retail locations.

        <u><b>Your payoff in words</b></u>: You will earn your show up fee of $5 plus two additional bonuses which are designed to incentivize good decision making: a cost savings bonus is equal to half of the difference between your sourcing budget and your wholesale offer, and a profit sharing bonus which is equal to half of the profit earned from retail sales.
 <br>
        <u><b>Your payoff in math</b></u>: <img ><br> <br>
        <b>Please note</b>: We provide you with a calculator for testing purposes, that displays both bonuses and your total payment for today’s work for any choice of R and W that you might consider. <br><br>


    You will then be asked to carefully finish a post-experiment survey.
