1. In the following, you'll face  a sequence of decisions listed on your screen. Each decision is a paired choice between "Option A" and "Option B".  "Option A" is a lottery that pays $0 with 50% probability and $25 with 50% probability; "Option B" yields a varying payoff for sure, i.e. with a probability of 100%.<br>
 When you are finished, one of your decisions will be randomly picked for your payoff. If you decided for "Option A", a random number will be drawn to determine your earnings; if you decided for "Option B" you'll receive the respective sure amount. <br>
            Which option could you like to choose?<br>

    <div class="controls">
         <input type="radio"  name="CEM_zero" value="0"> OptionA: A lottery pays you either $0 or $25 with 50-50 probability.  <br>
         <input type="radio"  name="CEM_zero" value="1"> OptionB: A guaranteed payout of $0 <br>
