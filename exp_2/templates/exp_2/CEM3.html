4. In the following, you'll face a sequence of decisions listed on your screen. Each decision is a paired choice between "Option A" and "Option B".  "Option A" is a lottery that pays $0 with 50% probability and $25 with 50% probability; "Option B" yields a varying payoff for sure, i.e. with a probability of 100%.<br>
 Which option could you like to choose?<br>

         <input type="radio"  name="CEM_three" value="1"> A guaranteed payout of $7.50 <br>
