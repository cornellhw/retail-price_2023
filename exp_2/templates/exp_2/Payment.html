            If the <u>Supplier</u> <b>accepts</b> your offer, your coffee will be offered for sale at the chain’s retail locations.

        <u><b>Your total payoff in words</b></u>: You will earn your show up fee of $7 plus two additional bonuses: a cost savings bonus is equal to half of the difference between your sourcing budget and your wholesale offer, and a revenue sharing bonus which is equal to half of the profit earned from retail sales.
 <br>
        <u><b>Your show up fee</b></u>: $7 <br> <br>
        <u><b>Your cost savings bonus</b></u>: 0.5 * (10 - W) <br> <br>
        <u><b>Your revenue savings bonus in math</b></u>: 0.5 * [R * {28(1−(R−1)/(7−1))}−W]  <br> <br>
        <u><b>Your total payment for today's work: bonus</b></u>: $7 + 0.5 * (10 - W) + 0.5 * [R * {28(1−(R−1)/6)}−W] <br> <br>
        <b> We provide you with a calculator for testing purposes, that displays both bonuses and your total payment for today’s work for any choice of R and W that you might consider. </b>
