            Your firm’s <b>market research division</b> is tasked with providing you with information needed to make good wholesale and retail pricing decisions.<br>

<h2>Supplier Cost Information:</h2>
The research division has found that the <u>average production cost</u> of all roasted coffee suppliers is normally distributed with an average cost of $6 per pound. However, any particular supplier’s <u>actual production cost</u> is private information. Research reports that it is normally distributed with an average cost of $6 per pound and standard deviation of $0.5.<br><br>

<h2>Consumer Information:</h2>
        Similarly, the research division has found that <u>on average</u> a retail customer is willing to pay 4 dollars per cup of high quality coffee. However, some customers are willing to pay much more, or less, than this amount. Research reports that retail customers are willing to pay anywhere between 1 and 7 dollars per cup, with equal possibility. <br><br>


        <u> Note:</u> Supplier cost is given per pound but consumer willingness to pay is given per cup. Your firm uses one pound of roasted beans to produce 28 cups of retail-ready coffee.<br><br>

        You should take this information into account when choosing a wholesale price <i><b>(W)</b></i> and a retail price <i><b>(R)</b></i>.
