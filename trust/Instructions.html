        Instructions
    </h3>
    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        One of you will be selected at random to be participant A;
        the other will be participant B.
        You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any
        decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start, participant A receives {{ C.ENDOWMENT }};
        participant B receives
        nothing.
        Participant A can send some or all of
        her {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} to participant B.
        Before B receives this amount, it will be multiplied
        by {{ C.MULTIPLIER }}. Once B receives
        the tripled amount she can decide to send some or all of it to
        A.
    </p>

        At the end of the experiment, your final points from this game will
        be converted to a dollar payment using the following exchange
        rate: <b>1 point = 0.02 dollars.</b>
