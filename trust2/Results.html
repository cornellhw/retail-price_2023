        You chose to send {{ sent_amount_points }}.
        The other participant returned {{ sent_back_amount_points }}.

    <p>
        You were initially endowed with {{ endowment_points }},
        chose to send {{ sent_amount_points }},
        and received {{ sent_back_amount_points }}
        thus you now have:
        {{ endowment_points }} - {{ sent_amount_points }} + {{ sent_back_amount_points }} = <strong>{{ payoff_points }}</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You will receive: {{ player.participant.vars.payoff_trust }} in this part of the experiment.
