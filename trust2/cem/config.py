    # type of variation
    # the app allows to vary one of the following parameters: the sure payoff, the probability of the high payoff,
    # or the high or low lottery payoff; the remaining three parameters are held constant for all choices
    # possible values for <variation> are 'sure_payoff' (Cohen et al., 1987; Abdellaoui et al., 2011)
    # 'probability' (Bruner, 2009), 'lottery_hi' (Bruner, 2009), or 'lottery_lo' (Gächter et al., 2007)
    variation = 'sure_payoff'

    # number (n) of choices with <i = 1, 2, ..., n>
    # <num_choices> determines how many choices between a lottery and a sure payoff shall be implemented
    num_choices = 9

    # "high" and "low" payoffs (in currency units set in settings.py) of the lottery "option A"
    # the lottery payoffs remain constant if <variation = 'sure_payoff'> or <variation = 'probability'>
    # if <variation = 'lottery_hi'>, <lottery_hi> constitutes the high lottery payoff for the first choice
    # for subsequent choices <i>, the high lottery outcome is determined by <lottery_hi> + <i-1> * <step_size>
    # if <variation = 'lottery_lo'>, <lottery_lo> constitutes the low lottery payoff for the first choice
    # for subsequent choices <i>, the high lottery outcome is determined by <lottery_lo> - <i-1> * <step_size>
    lottery_hi = 30.00
    lottery_lo = 0.00

    # probability of lottery outcome "high" in %
    # the probability of lottery payoffs is constant if <variation = 'sure_payoff'> or <variation = 'lottery_*'>
    # if <variation = 'probability'>, <probability> determines the likelihood of the high payoff in the first choice
    # for subsequent choices <i>, the probability is determined by <probability> + <i-1> * <step_size>
    probability = 50

    # sure payoff ("option B")
    # the sure payoff remains constant if <variation = 'probability'> or <variation = 'lottery_*'>
    # if <variation = 'sure_payoff'>, <sure_payoff> constitutes the certain payment ("option B") in the first choice
    # for subsequent choices <i>, the certain payment is determined by <sure_payoff> + <i-1> * <step_size>
    sure_payoff = 10.00

    # step size (in units of the parameter defined in <variation>)
    # the variable <variation> defines which of the four parameters is varied across the <num_choices> choices
    # <step_size> constitutes the increment in terms of the varying parameter (while the remaining three are constant)
    # thus, the varying parameter for choice i = 1, 2, ..., n, <var_i>, is defined by <var> + <i-1> * <step_size>
    # if <variation> is set to 'sure_payoff', 'lottery_hi', or 'lottery_lo', <step_size> is in currency units
    # if <variation> is set to 'probability', <step_size> is in percentage units (i.e. <step_size>%)
    step_size = 2.50

    # initial endowment (in currency units set in settings.py)
    # <endowment> defines an additional endowment for the task to capture potential losses if <variation = lottery_lo>
    # if no additional endowment should be implemented, set <endowment> to 0
    endowment = 0.00
